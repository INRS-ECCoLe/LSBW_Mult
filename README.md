# LSBW_Mult (LUT-Based Segmatated Baugh-Wooley Multiplier)
This repository contains an original approximation multiplier architecture for signed multiplication on FPGAs. The approach involves a novel segmentation method applied to the Baugh-Wooley multiplication algorithm. Each segment is optimally accommodated within LUT resources of modern AMD-Xilinx FPGA families.

This work was presented in the following paper at AICAS-2024:
S. Vakili, "A Cost-Effective Baugh-Wooley Approximate Multiplier for FPGA-Based Machine Learning Computing," *IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems (AICAS 2024)*, 2024.
