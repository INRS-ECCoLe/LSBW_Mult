# LSBW_Mult (LUT-Based Segmatated Baugh-Wooley Multiplier)
This repository contains an original approximation multiplier architecture for signed multiplication on FPGAs. The approach involves a novel segmentation method applied to the Baugh-Wooley multiplication algorithm. Each segment is optimally accommodated within LUT resources of modern AMD-Xilinx FPGA families.
